 * Smarty truncate modifier plugin.  This differs from the standard Smarty plugin
 * in that it respects HTML entities and doesn't split them.
 *
 * Type:     modifier<br>
 * Name:     entitytruncate<br>
 * Purpose:  Truncate a string to a certain length if necessary,
 *           optionally splitting in the middle of a word, and
 *           appending the $etc string.  Won't split an HTML entity.
 *
 * @param string $string the input string
 * @param int $length what to truncate it to (max length upon return)
 * @param string $etc what to use to indicate that there was more (default: "...")
 * @param boolean $breakWords break words or not?
 * @return string
