"Multiroot allows you to create an alternate URL to view part of the Gallery.  This "

"This option defines a default album for this view and adjusts navigation links so that no "
"parent albums above the default are shown.  Both guests and logged in users accessing the "
"alternate URL will see this effect.  However, Gallery permissions are unchanged so modules "
"like imageblock and search, or manually entered URLs, can lead visitors to items outside the "
"default album.  This option is easier to setup as it uses guest permissions already defined "
"for your Gallery."

msgid ""
"This option defines a new guest view with permissions defined for exactly what this view "
"should display.  Guests using the alternate URL cannot see any items outside those granted "
"permission, by browsing or via any modules or URLs.  Logged in users see whatever their "
"permissions allow, whether accessing the normal or alternate URL.  This option provides "
"greater access control over the alternate view, but requires additional permissions setup:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The original/real guest user must have view permission for all items accessible by any "
"alternate guest user.  The form below assists in creation of an alternate guest and will "
"assign view permission for the default album and all subalbums/items.  If these albums are "
"already public and can remain that way, no more setup is required.  Setup for mutually "
"exclusive views is more complicated: the original guest user must have access to items in "
"all views, so first setup those permissions.  Then use the tools here to create each "
"alternate view.  Just use the set of alternate URLs.  Keep the original Gallery URL "
"unpublished as it shows the combined set of items."
