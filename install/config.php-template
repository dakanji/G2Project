 *
 * Create an empty directory anywhere you please.  Gallery will fill this
 * directory with its own files (that you shouldn't mess with).  This directory
 * can be anywhere on your filesystem.  For security purposes, it's better
 * if the directory is not accessible via your webserver (ie, it should
 * not be in your DocumentRoot).  If you *do* make it available via your
 * web server then you probably won't have any security for your data files.

/*
 * Gallery can store its data in multiple different back ends.  Currently we
 * support MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.  Enter the hostname where your
 * database lives, and the username and password you use to connect to it.
 *
 * You must specify the name of a database that already exists.  Gallery will
 * not create the database for you, because it's very difficult to do that in
 * a reliable, database-neutral fashion.  The user that you use should have
 * the following permissions:
 *
 *    SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER
 *
 * You must specify a table and column prefix.  This is a few characters that
 * is prepended to any table or column name to avoid conflicting with reserved
 * words in the database or other tables you have in the same database.  In
 * fact, it's fine to let Gallery uses the same database as other applications
 * (including other instances of Gallery itself); the prefix is enough
 * to distinguish Gallery's tables from other applications.
 *
 * We provide some reasonable default prefixes below.  If you modify these
 * after Gallery has created its various tables, it will stop working until
 * you modify it back.
 *
 * The possible database types are:
 *  mysqlt       MySQL (3.23.34a and newer)
 *  mysqli       MySQL (4.1 and newer) with PHP mysqli extension
 *  mysql        Older MySQL (no transactions)
 *  postgres7    PostgreSQL 7.x and newer
 *  postgres     PostgreSQL 6.x (not tested)
 *  oci8po       Oracle 9i and newer
 *  db2          IBM DB2 9 and newer
 *  ado_mssql    Microsoft SQL Server (2005 and newer)
