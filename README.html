		<h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
		<p>
			Welcome to the community release of Gallery 2.4. It is codenamed <em>Phoenix</em> to reflect Gallery 2's rise from ashes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please read through this document carefully before installing Gallery 2 and before asking for help. We have taken care to try to answer as many of your questions here as possible. If you do not read this and have problems, you may be referred back to this document as a first resource.
		</p>
		<h3 id="quick_start">Quick Start</h3>
		<p>
			If you are impatient like us, you just want to get going. The odds are that your system is all set to handle Gallery 2 so just skip right to the <a href="install/index.php">installer</a> and start clicking. It should walk you through everything you need to get going. If you hit a snag, please come back here and read more before asking questions! Enjoy.
		</p>
		<h3 id="what_is_gallery_2">What is Gallery 2?</h3>
		<p>
			Gallery 2 is a web based software product that lets you manage your photos on your own website. You must have your own website with PHP and database support in order to install and use it.
		</p>
		<p>
			With Gallery 2, you can easily create and maintain albums of photos via an intuitive interface. Photo management includes automatic thumbnail creation, image resizing, rotation, ordering, captioning, searching and more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Albums and photos can have view, edit, delete and other permissions per individual authenticated user for an additional level of privacy. It is great for communities - give accounts to your friends and family and let them upload and manage their own photos on your website!

		<h3 id="whats_new">What is New in this Release?</h3>
		<p>
			Several years of design and development have gone into making Gallery 2 the best online photo management product available. We have made it easy to add new features while keeping them in separate modules so that you can customize it to only have the ones that you want. It is a powerful application and you are in the driver's seat.

						The interface for installing modules is now much easier to use. It shows you all the modules and lets you select the ones you want to install, and lets you repeat the process as often as you like.
					</li>
					<li>
						Added better instructions and examples for several steps that were confusing (your user feedback at work!)
					</li>
					<li>
						The installer now works on browsers that do not allow cookies.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>User Interface enhancements</b> - Some changes in our main layout place the most important system links on top of every page (Site Admin, Login, Logout, ...). This gives you easy access to these commands. The sidebar has some improved functionality, like a direct login form and some more details on your cart and members (if those modules are active). This is another step towards a "block" system where modules can provide any amount of blocks of information to be placed in the sidebar.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Navigation</b> - It is now easier to navigate around Gallery. Meaningful "back" links will bring you back to the last visited pages, e.g. it is now possible to visit the Site Admin while editing an album and have an easy way to return.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Random Highlight</b> - New module allows albums to periodically change highlight, selecting randomly from the album's items.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>WebCam</b> - New module creates items that periodically refresh the image from an external URL.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Thumbnail Page</b> - New module gives more control over thumbnails for movies and documents. For multipage documents (like PDF/Postscript) or images (like multiscene TIFF) you can pick the page number for the thumbnail (Note: PDF/Postscript require both ImageMagick and Ghostscript). When used in conjunction with the Ffmpeg module you can pick a time offset for generating thumbnails for movies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Graphics Toolkits</b> -
				<ul>
					<li>
						The ImageMagick and NetPBM toolkits have been optimized to make fewer calls to external binaries when used for multiple operations. For example, cropping and resizing to make a thumbnail now requires only a single call to "convert" with ImageMagick.
					</li>
					<li>
						We now preserve extra operations (like crop settings) on thumbnails when moving an item between albums or rebuilding thumbnails.
					</li>
					<li>
						Added ability to set toolkit priority. This means you can activate multiple toolkits to support more mime types but still select which toolkit is used in cases where multiple toolkits support the same type.
					</li>
					<li>
						Added support for ImageMagick 6.1.x
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Sort Order</b> - "Default sort order" and "Manual sort order" are now separate choices, allowing albums to properly inherit the site default for sort order; Ascending/descending is disabled for these choices.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>New Items</b> - New module shows "new" and "updated" images next to appropriate images and albums, and adds a new sort where new items are shown first followed by other items sorted by view count.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>SMTP Authentication</b> - We now support sending email via a SMTP server that requires user authentication. Any module that sends email (like the registration module) can take advantage of this support.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Embedding Gallery 2</b> - We have made great improvements in embedding Gallery 2 into other applications. We have successfully (though not completely) embedded it into Xaraya and have begun working on other platforms. See <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Embedding" target="_blank">Gallery 2 Embedding</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Thumbnail Creation</b> - We now let you create thumbnails at upload time, which greatly improves performance the first time you view an album. It is optional, but on by default.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Improved Error Pages</b> - We now show you a nice error page when two simultaneous and conflicting changes happen. This new page explains how to resolve the problem.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Members</b> - We now show a list of the recent changes that a user has made, and let you page through the entire list of changes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Removed IE7</b> - We were experimenting with <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>, a compatibility layer in JavaScript reduces some of the incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers. However we were not able to get the performance and reliability that we needed so we have decided to abandon using it (at least for now).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Localization</b> - Gallery 2 is now translated into 18 languages, though only German, Danish and Swedish are over 50% translated. We can use your help!
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bug fixes</b> - Many bugs closed!
			</li>

		<ol id="alpha3-list" style="display:none">
			<li>
				<b>Watermark Support</b> - We now support image watermarking. You can add a watermark to the thumbnail, resize or full sized version of an image using a DHTML drag-and-drop interface.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Oracle Database Support</b> - The installer now offers Oracle (version 9i and higher) among the supported database types.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Module Manifests</b> - All modules now come with a manifest file, and the installer checks to make sure that you have got a complete set of files on the server.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Auto Completion</b> - the Site Admin user and groups pages, and the permissions pages now perform appropriate completion for you. Just type a few characters of the username you are searching for and it will give you up to 10 possible matches. Tested on Firefox, but not extensively tested on IE yet.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>New version of IE7</b> - We are experimenting with <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>, a compatibility layer in JavaScript reduces some of the incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers. The older version caused weird problems with images getting overlaid with a red X, or IE6 crashing.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Migration improvements</b> -
				<ul>
					<li>
						We now properly migrate item owners
					</li>
					<li>
						We now preserve the order of imported subalbums
					</li>
					<li>
						Gallery 1 summary and description fields are now transposed on import so that the Gallery 1 "summary" (which was shown inside the album itself) is now the Gallery 2 "description" and vice versa.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>CMS Integration</b> - Although this is not yet readily visible, a great deal of work has been done on getting Gallery 2 ready to integrate into external content management systems. We have successfully done partial integrations with <a href="http://www.xaraya.com/" target="_blank">Xaraya</a> and <a href="http://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, with more on the way.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Square Thumbnails</b> - We fixed a noticeable bug where the first time you viewed a square thumbnail it might appear distorted (this was mentioned in the "known bugs" list of the alpha-2 release).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Zip Cart Plugin</b> - You can now download the contents of your cart as a zip file.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>User Albums</b> - You can use the new User Albums module to automatically create a new album for a user whenever you create a new user.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Installer</b> - Many minor tweaks including adding more install checks to make sure that your system is OK.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Members</b> - The members module now has privacy settings so that you can prevent the unauthorized from seeing your list of members, and/or their email addresses.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bug fixes</b> - Many bugs closed!

		<h3 id="packages">Choosing a Package</h3>
		You can choose from four different packages:
		<dl>
			<dt><b>Minimal</b></dt>
			<dd>
				The base application, 2 themes and 3 graphics toolkits and only English installed. Everything you need to publish photos, and nothing more.
			</dd>
			<dt><b>Typical</b></dt>
			<dd>
				The base application, 8 themes and a selection of popular modules. Enough to satisfy the demands of most Gallery users.
			</dd>
			<dt><b>Typical-en</b></dt>
			<dd>
				Same as <b>Typical</b> except the only language included is English.
			</dd>
			<dt><b>Full</b></dt>
			<dd>
				The base application, 9 themes and 68 modules. Every cool feature we have got.
			</dd>
			<dt><b>Full-en</b></dt>
			<dd>
				Same as <b>Full</b> except the only language installed is English.
			</dd>
			<dt><b>Developer</b></dt>
			<dd>
				Same as <b>Full</b>, except it includes all the developer tools so that you can work on improving the code.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			You get to pick and choose which modules you activate, so even if you download a package that has more modules than you need you can always choose not to activate the ones you do not want. You can also activate a module and test it out for a while, then later deactivate and uninstall it. You can also delete any modules/themes that you are not using if you want to save space.
		</p>
		<p>
			All of our modules and themes are available separately so if you install a smaller package you can still add more functionality later on, either by downloading yourself or using the Downloadable Plugins feature in the Site Admin section.

		<ol>
			<li id="get_latest_code">
				<b>Codebase</b> - There are four ways to get the code.
				<dl>
					<dt>- Pre-Installer</dt>
					<dd>
						The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://github.com/dakanji/G2Project-preinstaller/releases" target="_blank">Gallery 2 Pre-Installer</a>. It transfers the archive directly to your webserver and extracts it for you and is particularly useful if you only have FTP access to your webserver and do not have the option to extract zip or tar files directly on the server.
					</dd>
					<dt>- Released Package</dt>
					<dd>
						You can download a prepackaged release as a tarball or a zip file from <a href="https://github.com/dakanji/G2Project-main/releases" target="_blank">Github</a>.
					</dd>
					<dt>- Current Snapshot</dt>
					<dd>
						You can download an archive file with a snapshot of the most recent code. The link to this is: <a href="https://github.com/dakanji/G2Project-main/archive/dev.zip" >https://github.com/dakanji/G2Project-main/archive/dev.zip</a>.
					</dd>
					<dt>- Git Clone</dt>
					<dd>
						This is a better way to get the latest code, but it is for <i>advanced</i> users. Clone the Github Repository at <em>https://github.com/dakanji/G2Project-main.git</em>. It is easier to stay up to date with this method since you can run one command and get the latest code at any time.
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Storage</b> - Create a directory for gallery to store photos. This must be writeable by the web server, but for security reasons we suggest that you do not put it in the web root. If you put it in the web root, then anybody can get directly to your images with their web browser which circumvents Gallery 2's security.
				<div class="instructions">
					<h3>Unix Example</h3>
					<p>$ cd $HOME <br>$ mkdir g2data <br>$ chmod 777 g2data</p>
				</div>
				<div class="instructions">
					<h3>Windows Example</h3>
					<p>C:\&gt; mkdir g2data</p>
				</div>
				In the Unix example, you may note that modes of <em>777</em> on your <em>g2data</em> directory are not very secure. However, making it more secure depends on how your system is configured. Talk with your system administrator about ways to change the permissions on that directory to make it so that Gallery 2 can write to the files but that others not. Refer to the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Security">Gallery 2 Security Guide</a> for more information.
			</li>
			<li>
				<div>
					<p>
						<b>Database</b> - Right now we only support <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> or equivalent.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may also be able to use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-ftp.html" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/" target="_blank">IBM DB2</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite</a> but as from Gallery 2.4, these are only kept as legacy code and not activly developed. Third party developers are free to contribute updates as required.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					In our example below, we will be creating a database called <b>gallery2</b>. You can use any database name you wish.
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Grant all required privileges to your database user.
						<br>
						This includes but is not confined to: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE in the gallery2 database; SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on all (gallery2) tables in the gallery2 database; CREATE INDEX and some other privileges that are specific to the different database management systems. CREATE/DROP DATABASE and the ability to GRANT privileges to other database users are not required.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="instructions">
					<h3>MySQL</h3>
					<p>
						$ mysqladmin -uroot create gallery2 <br>$ mysql gallery2 -uroot -e"GRANT ALL ON gallery2.* TO
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>username</strong>@localhost IDENTIFIED BY <strong>'password'</strong>"<br>
					</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="note">
					<li>
						Choose your own username and password
					</li>
					<li>
						If MySQL denies you access, try adding <em>-p</em> right after <em>-uroot</em> in each command
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Graphics Toolkits</b> - Gallery 2 works with many different toolkits (<a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">NetPBM</a>, <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a>, <a href="http://php.net/gd" target="_blank">GD</a> or <a href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/" target="_blank">GraphicsMagick</a>).
				<br>
				You need to activate at least one or you would not get any thumbnails, but there's no limit on how many you can have. In fact, more is better because they can work together.

		<h3 id="installing">Installing Gallery 2</h3>
		<p>
			Gallery 2 is a web application and must be installed on your web server in order for you to use it. If you have unpacked it on your desktop, you will have to upload it to your server as part of the install process. Then you can configure it using your web browser.<br>As an alternative to the lengthy upload via FTP, take a look at the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Preinstaller" target="_blank">Gallery 2 Pre-Installer</a>.
		</p>
		<ol style="margin-top: 0.2em">
			<li>
				<b>Upload</b> - Copy the Gallery 2 files to a directory on your webserver. There are several alternatives for this step:
				<ul style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0">
					<li>
						<b>Fastest way</b>: Upload the gallery package to your web server archive via FTP or another method, then unpack it using an interactive shell session (e.g. ssh or telnet). Example unpacking commands (choose the appropriate one):
						<div class="instructions">
							<h3>For .tar.gz archives</h3>
							<p>$ tar xzf gallery2.tar.gz</p>
						</div>
						<div class="instructions">
							<h3>For zip archives</h3>
							<p>$ unzip gallery2.zip</p>
						</div>
						If you do not have shell access, you can ask your provider to do it for you, or you can make a miniature PHP script containing one of the above commands. Some webhosting companies offer a control panel with a web file-browser which is capable of extracting / unarchiving archive files. It is worth a try to check if this option is available.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Easiest (but slowest) way:</b> If you don't have shell access, you can upload the complete contents of the Gallery 2 archive to the webserver with an FTP program. This may take a lot of time and be error-prone. In this case, pay special attention to the &rsquo;System Checks&rsquo; step of the installer and make sure that there are no missing or modified files. Consider using a smart FTP program like <a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a> to make sure that your transfer goes smoothly.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Advanced way</b>: The best way to install Gallery <b>and</b> stay up to date if you have shell access to your webserver is to use <a href="https://github.com/dakanji/G2Project-main" target="_blank">Github</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Note:</b> After uploading, you should close this version of the README and browse to the version that you just uploaded. That way all the links in this document will point to the right places in your Gallery 2 install.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Begin Installing</b> - Open up your web browser and browse to the <a href="install/index.php">install directory</a>. Gallery 2 will walk you through the process of validating that your system is properly configured and will set everything up for you.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Authenticate</b> - You will be asked to create and save a small text file in order to authenticate. You may not proceed until you do this. That is how Gallery 2 knows that you are authorized to use the installer.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>System Checks</b> - The installer checks your system to make sure that it will support Gallery 2. Make sure that all checks are successful!
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Installation Type</b> - Gallery can support multiple independent sites with a single installation of the code. Here you will select a standard single install or the location of a new multisite install. There is more information about multisite in the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Multisite" target="_blank">Gallery Codex</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Storage Setup</b> - Read the instructions on the installer to set up a storage location for Gallery 2. This is where Gallery 2 will store all of your images, as well as other cache information.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Database Setup</b> - Select your database type and enter your database authentication information. If this is not your first Gallery 2 installation and there are still some remains of the old installation, it will check the state of the installed version and offer a clean install option which will delete all your data in the storage directory and in the database. If the installed version seems to be fine, it will also offer to reuse the existing database tables. Select this option if you did not start the installer with the intent to start from scratch.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Admin User Setup</b> - You are prompted for an administrator username and password. Type in a password and type it again to validate it. The full name and the email address are optional. But entering an email address is highly recommended. Once you are finished, click &rsquo;Create&rsquo; to create the admin user for this installation of Gallery 2.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Create Config File</b> - Gallery 2 will create the <b>config.php</b> file in your Gallery 2 directory. This contains all the answers you have provided in the installer and is necessary for Gallery 2 to function properly. At this point, there is also a sanity check to prevent you from damaging your Gallery install by running the installer when you should rather have started the upgrader.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Install the Core module</b> - Here is where we create all the database tables and initial users and albums to get you started. Unless something goes wrong, there is nothing for you to do here.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Install other modules</b> - Gallery 2 has lots of different modules that provide useful functionality. Choose which ones you want to use. You can always go to the <a href="main.php?g2_view=core.SiteAdmin">Site Admin Page</a> later on to install, activate, deactivate or uninstall modules. Therefore, it is ok to experiment here.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Check Security</b> - Gallery 2 walks you through the process of locking down your new config.php file.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Finished!</b> - Congratulations! You have successfully installed Gallery 2!

			<h3>
				Warning When Upgrading from Gallery 2.0!
			</h3>
			<p>
				Third party modules and themes designed for Gallery 2.0 will not work with Gallery 2.3. During the upgrade process, these modules and themes will be automatically deactivated for you. You can find updated versions for most of these modules and themes here: <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:User_Contributions">http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:User_Contributions</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<ol>
			<li>
				If you have a busy site, consider putting your Gallery in maintenance mode before updating the code and performing the upgrade. This gives visitors a message that the site is temporarily offline, rather than showing everybody the upgrade page. Edit your config.php file to activate maintenance mode. This feature is new starting in 2.1, so it is not available in an upgrade from 2.0.x.
			</li>
			<li>
				Download the latest code for any active third party modules that you are using, or deactivate them. If in doubt, deactivating is safe.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#get_latest_code">Get the latest code</a> and unpack it over your existing copy of Gallery 2. Keep your existing config.php in place, and don't touch your (g2data) data folder or the database. If you are using Git, you can just do "git update" at any time. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Preinstaller" target="_blank">Gallery 2 Pre-Installer</a> to get the latest codebase.
			</li>
			<li>If you use a PHP accelerator / cache (e.g. Turk mmCache, Ioncube PHPA, eaccelerator, Zend Studio, etc.), flush (clear) the cache of the accelerator. Omitting this step can <i>sometimes</i> lead to errors during and after the upgrade process.
			</li>
			<li>Browse to the <a href="upgrade/index.php">upgrader</a> and follow the instructions there. <b>Make a backup of your data</b> (g2data folder and especially the database) when it tells you to! Should you lose your data due to a bug in the upgrader, the first thing we are going to tell you to do is to restore from your backups! (Then we will probably ask you to help reproduce the bug.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Enjoy your new version of Gallery 2.

			</li>
			<li>
				Search the forum to see if somebody else has posted a similar problem and maybe there is an answer there, otherwise start a new topic to get help.
			</li>
			<li>
				If the problem seems like a bug in the Gallery 2 software you can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=7130&amp;atid=107130" target="_blank">file a bug</a> in our bug tracker on SourceForge. Please read our <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/wiki/Feature_Requests_and_Bug_Reports" target="_blank">tracker guidelines</a> before filing a bug so that we can cut down on the number of spurious reports.

			<li>
				If you are unsure whether to file a bug you can always post in the forums first and we will ask you to file a bug if needed. If you want to chat in real time, you can talk on our user-to-user irc support channel, <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#gallery-support" target="_blank">#gallery-support on chat.freenode.net (irc client)</a> or <a href="http://jtty.com/GallerySupport">#gallery-support (web based irc)</a>

		<p>
			Remember &ndash; reporting bugs is <b>good</b>. Even if you think it is silly, go ahead and report it. We can always close the bug or refile it (please do not be offended in this case) but it is harder to find bugs than it is to fix them so we are counting on you to help us with the finding part.

			<b>Unit Tests</b> - Gallery 2 was designed using <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=extreme+programming" target="_blank">Extreme Programming</a> methodologies. This means that we have over 2,000 unit tests that ensure code quality. If you want to help out, you can run <a href="lib/tools/phpunit/index.php">the unit tests</a> and report back to us if any of them fail.<br>
		</p>
		<p style="margin: 0 0 0 10px">
			<b>Note</b> - these tests should not change your Gallery 2 settings at all, but if they fail, they may leave things in a weird state. Be warned that there is a slim chance that you might have to ditch your Gallery 2 data and start over if something catastrophic happens.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>For Themers</b> - There is now some <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Themes">theme documentation</a> that you should read if you want to change the look of your Gallery 2 by customizing an existing theme and its templates or by creating your own theme.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Localization</b> - If you are interested in translating Gallery 2 into another language, you can review the <a href="lib/tools/reports/localization.php">current state of localization</a> and then read the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Localization">localization how-to</a> and get started. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=582564&amp;group_id=7130&amp;func=browse">Submit your localizations</a> early and often - no need to wait until you are entirely done.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>For Developers</b> - We have gotten started on some <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/dev">developer documentation</a> that you should read if you want to start hacking on Gallery 2. Some of the information is a little bit out of date or in early drafts, but it is a start.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Embedding</b> - To learn more about embedding Gallery 2 into your website and about existing integrations in content management systems, portals, blogs etc. please see <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Embedding" target="_blank">Gallery 2 Embedding</a>.
