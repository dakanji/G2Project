= Introduction =

Welcome to the Community Update Project for Gallery 2¬ù, web based software product that lets you manage your photos on your own website.
This effort aims towards the development of community backed updates to Gallery 2. 

Official development of Gallery 2 has stopped in favour of Gallery 3 but since Gallery 3 still has some way to go on the development path, 
Gallery 2 remains today for many, in testament to the work of the development team, the most powerful, most fully featured and most flexible and agile choice.

The aim of this effort is to add enhancements and fixes to the code and for these to be pushed to the official repository.
