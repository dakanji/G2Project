= Introduction =

Welcome to the Community Update Project for Gallery 2, a web based software product that lets you manage your photos on your own website.
This effort aims towards the development of community backed updates to Gallery 2. 

Official development of Gallery 2 has stopped in favour of Gallery 3 but as Gallery 3 never really quite got to the same level, 
Gallery 2 remained for many, in testament to the work of the development team, the most powerful, most fully featured and most flexible and agile choice.

In any case, development of Gallery 3 soon came to a halt and with that, an end to the Official Gallery Project.
The aim of this effort is to add enhancements and fixes to the Gallery 2 code so that its several loyal fans can continue using this awesome piece of software engineering.
